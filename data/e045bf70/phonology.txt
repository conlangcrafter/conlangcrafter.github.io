      "issue": "The analysis presented in Issue 1 is incorrect. It claims the word /t̪a.ʡd̪ʱa/ violates vowel harmony because it 'contains both a low vowel (/a/) and a mid vowel'. However, the provided transcription contains only the low vowel /a/. The word is therefore perfectly compliant with the stated harmony rule. The issue identifies a violation based on a false premise.",
      "type": "error",
      "correction": "The issue should be removed, as the word /t̪a.ʡd̪ʱa/ does not violate the vowel harmony rule as written. A real violation would need to mix vowels from the {e, o} set and the {a} set, for example */t̪o.ʡa/.",

    {
      "issue": "The analysis in Issue 2 is incoherent and does not identify a valid phonological problem. It begins by incorrectly identifying /ʢʱu.t̪a/ as a violation, correctly retracts this, fails to find any other violations, and ultimately concludes by re-stating the erroneous claim from Issue 1. It serves only to document the analyst's confusion.",
      "type": "error",
      "correction": "This entire issue should be removed. It fails to identify an actual error in the phonology and should be replaced with a valid issue if one exists.",

      "issue": "The analysis in Issue 3 incorrectly assesses the syllable structure of /d̪ʱa.ʡt̪aːʢʱ/. It claims the second syllable, /ʡt̪aːʢʱ/, has a 'CCVCC' structure that violates the (C)(C)V(C)(C) template. This is false. The syllable /ʡt̪aːʢʱ/ has an onset /ʡt̪/ (CC), a nucleus /aː/ (V), and a coda /ʢʱ/ (C). The resulting structure is CCVC. This structure is perfectly valid under a (C)(C)V(C)(C) template. The analysis fabricates a violation by miscounting the coda consonants.",

      "issue": "The analysis in Issue 4 correctly identifies a significant ambiguity in the Nasal Harmony rule but uses a speculative example. The rule for prenasalization does not specify how it applies to consonant clusters, which could lead to phonetically improbable outcomes.",
      "type": "ambiguity",
      "correction": "The issue is valid but should be grounded in the language's constraints. It should state: 'The rules for nasal harmony do not specify how prenasalization applies to licit consonant clusters, creating an ambiguity. For any word containing a valid onset cluster and a nasal trigger, it is unclear if both members of the cluster are prenasalized, only one is, or if clusters are exempt.'",

    {
      "issue": "The analysis in Issue 5 correctly identifies an inconsistency in the use of syllable break markers. However, its justification is weak. It suggests that an unsyllabified /t̪aʡa/ could be misinterpreted as a single syllable, which is phonologically implausible as a VCV sequence cannot form a single nucleus. The core problem is one of notational inconsistency, not a potential structural violation.",
      "type": "ambiguity",
      "correction": "The issue is valid, but the reasoning should be refined. A better phrasing is: 'The lexicon is notationally inconsistent, as some polysyllabic words lack syllable break markers (e.g., /t̪aʡa/) while others have them (e.g., /ʢ̰eː.t̪e/). For maximum clarity, all polysyllabic words should be explicitly syllabified, even when the parsing is unambiguous due to principles like Maximal Onset.'",
