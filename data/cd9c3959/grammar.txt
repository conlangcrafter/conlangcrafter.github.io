# Grammar

## Morphology

The language is fusional, with grammatical information often encoded through non-concatenative means like vowel changes, accent shifts, and phonation type, a system necessitated by the strict (C)V syllable structure. Nouns are inflected for number (singular/plural) and their role as a possessor, while verbs inflect for aspect and mood.

**Noun Morphology:** Nouns belong to one of two classes: Animate or Inanimate. This distinction is fundamental, affecting pluralization, possessive marking, and allowing for metaphorical reclassification.

*   **Pluralization:** The plural is formed by changing or adding to the final syllable of the noun stem and often shifting the accent. The specific change depends on the noun class.
    *   Animate nouns typically form the plural by changing the final vowel to /u/, which takes the accent.
    *   Inanimate nouns form the plural by adding a final V-syllable /-i/, which takes the accent.

    *kâtā* (person, SG) -> *kātû* (people, PL.ANIM)
    *pāt̪â* (house, SG) -> *pāt̪āī* (houses, PL.INAN)

*   **Noun Class Shifting (Metaphorical Reclassification):** A noun can be deliberately inflected using the morphology of the "wrong" class for metaphorical, personifying, or pejorative effect.
    *   **Animate -> Inanimate:** Treating an animate noun as inanimate is highly pejorative and objectifying.
        *kâtā* (person) -> *kātāī* (PL.INAN) (Translated as "bodies," "rabble," or "a mere collection of individuals.")
    *   **Inanimate -> Animate:** Treating an inanimate noun as animate personifies it, attributing agency or a special quality.
        *pāt̪â* (house) -> *pāt̪û* (PL.ANIM) (Translated as "homes" in a personal sense, or a village with a collective character.)

*   **Possessive Marking:** A noun is marked as a possessor by adding breathy phonation to its final syllable. This is a fusional marker indicating genitive case.

    *kâtā* (person) -> *kâtā̤* (person's)
    *pāt̪â* (house) -> *pāt̪â̤* (house's)

*   **Derivational Morphology (Verbal Nouns):** Verbal nouns (gerunds) are formed from a verb's root by adding a final vowel /a/ and placing the accent on the first syllable. All other syllables become unaccented. These derived nouns are always grammatically inanimate and refer to the action of the verb.

    *kāt̪āv-* (root: walk) -> *kât̪āva* (the act of walking, a journey)
    *bādʑ-* (root: eat) -> *bâdʑa* (the act of eating, a meal)
    *cʰīk-* (root: see) -> *cʰîkā* (the act of seeing, sight)

    *xâɣa bâdʑa.*
    be.good.IND meal
    "The meal is good." / "Eating is good."

**Verb Morphology:** Verbs use a combination of synthetic and analytic strategies for TAM. Aspect (perfective/imperfective) and mood (indicative/irrealis/evidential) are marked synthetically on the verb root, while tense is expressed analytically with pre-verbal particles.

*   **Aspect:** The perfective/imperfective distinction is marked by ablaut of the verb's final vowel.
    *   *cʰîkā* (to see, IMPFV) -> *cʰîkū* (to see, PFV)

*   **Mood:** The language distinguishes three moods synthetically using phonation.
    *   **Indicative:** The default, unmarked form.
        *bādʑâ* (eat, IND)
    *   **Irrealis:** Used for hypotheticals, futures, and subjunctives. It is marked by adding breathy phonation to the verb's **accented** syllable.
        *bâ̤dʑā* (eat, IRR)
    *   **Evidential:** Used to specify that the speaker's knowledge is inferred or deduced. It is marked by adding breathy phonation to the verb's **final** syllable.
        *bādʑâ̤* (eat, EVID)
    *   These markings can be combined. When moods are combined, their phonological markers can co-occur, potentially resulting in more than one breathy syllable in the verb form.
        *bâ̤dʑā̤* (eat, IRR+EVID; "I deduce that he will probably eat.")

    *kāt̪āvâ̤ kâtā.*
    walk.EVID person
    "The person is walking (apparently/I infer)."

## Syntax

The language has a Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) constituent order. It is strictly dependent-marking, meaning grammatical roles are marked on the noun phrases (the dependents) rather than through agreement on the verb (the head).

**Argument Marking:** Grammatical roles are marked by a combination of rigid word order and adpositions. This creates an Ergative-Absolutive alignment pattern.
*   The Subject of an intransitive verb (S) and the Object of a transitive verb (O) together form the absolutive case. They appear bare (unmarked) following the verb, and their role is identified by position.
*   The Agent of a transitive verb (A) is marked with the ergative preposition *jā*.

(1) *bādʑâ jā kâtā pāt̪â.*
    eat.IND ERG person house
    "The person eats the house."

(2) *kāt̪āvâ kâtā.*
    walk.IND person
    "The person walks."

**Adpositions and Case:** While the core arguments use the preposition *jā* and word order, other semantic roles are marked by a small set of postpositions. Unusually for a VSO, head-initial language, these are postpositions that cliticize to the noun they follow, forming a single phonological word. The resulting word has only one accent, located on the same syllable that was accented in the host noun. The postpositional syllable itself is unaccented with a mid-tone. Postpositional phrases follow the core S and O arguments.
*   **Dative/Benefactive:** *-kʰā* "to, for"
*   **Locative:** *-t̪ā* "in, at, on"
*   **Ablative:** *-vâ* "from, out of"
*   **Instrumental:** *-si* "with, by means of"

(3) *dār̪âkʰa jā kâtā pāt̪ât̪ā.*
    see.IND ERG person house-LOC
    "The person sees in the house."

(4) *bādʑâ jā kâtā pʰāt̪â̤lūkʰā.*
    eat.IND ERG person dog-DAT
    "The person feeds the dog." (Lit: "The person eats for the dog.")
    (Note: The verb for "to eat" (*bādʑâ*) can be used with a dative/benefactive complement to mean "to feed".)

(5) *kāt̪āvâ kâtā pāt̪âvâ.*
    walk.IND person house-ABL
    "The person walks from the house."

**Noun Phrase Structure:** Noun phrases are head-initial, but possessors are an exception, creating a mixed structure. The order is Noun-Adjective-Numeral, but Genitive-Noun. The possessor, marked with breathy voice, directly precedes the possessed noun.

(6) *bādʑâ jā kâtā̤ pʰāt̪â̤lū.*
    eat.IND ERG person's dog
    "The person's dog eats."

**Adjectives and Adjectival Verbs:** There is no separate lexical class of "adjectives." Properties are expressed using intransitive stative verbs. To modify a noun, a relative clause structure is used via clause chaining. The adjectival verb is chained before the main verb, sharing its subject with the noun it modifies. This is a verb-initial clause chaining construction where a medial verb precedes the main finite verb, forming a complex predicate.

The adjectival verb appears in its medial form, which is identical to its full imperfective indicative form. For example, the stative verb "to be good" has the imperfective indicative form *xâɣa*, which is also its medial form.

(7) *xâɣa bādʑâ jā kâtā pāt̪â.*
    be.good.MED eat.IND ERG person house
    "The good person eats the house." (Lit: "Being good, eats ERG person the house.")

When an object needs to be modified, a separate, fully formed clause is required, as the chaining mechanism only shares subjects.

(8) *dār̪âkʰa jā kâtā pāt̪â. xâɣa pāt̪â.*
    see.IND ERG person house. be.good.IND house
    "The person sees the house. The house is good."

**Pro-Drop and Argument Structure:** The language has obligatory pro-drop. Any argument (subject or object) that is recoverable from discourse context or is semantically non-specific *must* be omitted.

(9) A: *dār̪âkʰa jā kâtā pāt̪â?* (Does the person see the house?)
    see.IND ERG person house
    B: *dār̪âkʰa jā.* (Yes, he/she sees it.)
    see.IND ERG
    (Lit: "Sees ERG.")

**The "Existential Pivot" Construction:** This is a mandatory construction for introducing new, indefinite participants into the discourse. The participant must first be introduced with the existential verb *i* in a clause preceding the main clause. This verb is obligatorily marked with breathy voice (*i̤*) to signal the introduction of a new, focused participant. The participant is then referred to via pro-drop in the main clause. Simple sentences in isolation (e.g., example 1) assume their participants are already known from context.

(10) *i̤ pʰāt̪â̤lū. bādʑâ.*
     exist.FOC dog. eat.IND
     "A dog eats." (Lit: "There exists a dog. [It] eats.")

(11) A: "What happened?"
     B: *i̤ kâtā. dār̪âkʰa jā pāt̪â.*
        exist.FOC person. see.IND ERG house
        "A person saw the house." (Lit: "There exists a person. [He] saw the house.")

**Subordination and Clause Chaining:** The primary strategy for creating complex sentences is clause chaining. A series of verbs can be chained together, with only the final verb being fully inflected for mood. Preceding verbs (medial verbs) appear in a neutral, non-finite form identical to their full imperfective indicative form. These medial verbs share their arguments with the final verb.

(12) *kāt̪āvā cʰîkā bādʑâ jā kâtā pāt̪â.*
     walk.MED see.MED eat.IND ERG person house
     "The person, while walking and seeing, eats the house."

(13) *kāt̪āvā cʰîkā bâ̤dʑā jā kâtā pāt̪â.*
     walk.MED see.MED eat.IRR ERG person house
     "The person will walk, see, and eat the house."
