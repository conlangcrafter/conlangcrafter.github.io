# Grammar

## Morphology

The language exhibits agglutinative morphology with non-concatenative root realization. Lexical roots for verbs are typically abstract templates defined solely by suprasegmental features: tone patterns, nasalization, and vowel height harmony (requiring all vowels in a word to match within high/i u/, mid/e o/, or low/ɛ a ɔ/ groups). Suppletive roots constitute exceptions to abstract root templates and may include inherent segmental content, though inflectional prefixes still mark agreement. They may exhibit non-standard syllable structures including CV.V and CV.CV while maintaining vowel height harmony and tone patterns. Inflectional prefixes supply segmental content and mark hierarchical agreement based on animacy (1>2>3.ANIM>3.INAN). Verbs exhibit direct forms when the agent outranks the patient on the animacy hierarchy and inverse forms otherwise. Root vowels change based on direct/inverse status following front/back alternation matching height: high roots use i/u, mid roots use e/o, low roots use ɛ/ɔ (excluding central /a/). Prefix vowels alternate based on direct/inverse status: direct forms use front vowels (i, e, ɛ) and inverse forms use back vowels (u, o, ɔ), matching the height group of the root vowel. Prefix vowels must also match the height group of the root vowel. Suppletive roots may fuse prefix and root vowels, with vowel alternation occurring within the fused syllable; in the examples provided, fusion does not occur. For 1st/2nd person agents or patients, verb forms do not distinguish between 3.ANIM and 3.INAN arguments. Forms like **kúù** ambiguously cover  cover 2sg>1sg, 3.ANIM>1sg, and 3.INAN>1sg, while direct forms for 1st person agents (e.g., **kíì**) ambiguously cover 1sg>2sg, 1sg>3.ANIM, and 1sg>3.INAN, with disambiguation relying solely on context or pronouns.

**Conjugation of 'go' (HL tone, oral, root vowel = high):**  
| Agent > Patient | Direct   | Inverse   |  
|----------------|----------|----------|  
| 1sg > 3.INAN  | **kíì** | - |  
| 2sg > 3.INAN  | **míì** | - |  
| 3.ANIM > 3.INAN | **íì**  | - |  
| 3.INAN > 3.ANIM | -        | **úù**  |  
| 1sg > 3.ANIM  | **kíì** | -        |  
| 3.ANIM > 1sg  | -        | **kúù**  |  
| 3.INAN > 1sg  | -        | **kúù**  |  
| 1sg > 2sg     | **kíì** | -        |  
| 2sg > 1sg     | -        | **kúù**  |  
| 2sg > 3.ANIM  | **míì** | -        |  
| 3.ANIM > 2sg  | -        | **múù**  |  
| 3.ANIM > 3.ANIM | -        | **úù**   |  

Example:  
kò ʔá tʃáɾà **kíì**  
FOC 1SG stone **go.1SG>3.INAN.DIR**  
"I go to the stone."  

Regular verb forms are disyllabic with CV.V structure (e.g., [ki.ì] for kíì).

**Conjugation of 'see' (LL tone, nasalized, root vowel = high):**  
| Agent > Patient | Direct     | Inverse     |  
|----------------|------------|------------|  
| 1sg > 3.INAN  | **kĩ̀ĩ̀**  | - |  
| 2sg > 3.INAN  | **mĩ̀ĩ̀**  | - |  
| 3.ANIM > 3.INAN | **ĩ̀ĩ̀**   | - |  
| 3.INAN > 3.ANIM | -          | **ũ̀ũ̀**   |  
| 1sg > 3.ANIM  | **kĩ̀ĩ̀**  | -          |  
| 3.ANIM > 1sg  | -          | **kũ̀ũ̀**   |  
| 3.INAN > 1sg  | -          | **kũ̀ũ̀**   |  
| 1sg > 2sg     | **kĩ̀ĩ̀**  | -          |  
| 2sg > 1sg     | -          | **kũ̀ũ̀**   |  
| 2sg > 3.ANIM | **mĩ̀ĩ̀**  | -          |  
| 3.ANIM > 2sg  | -          | **mũ̀ũ̀**   |  
| 3.ANIM > 3.ANIM | -          | **ũ̀ũ̀**    |  

Example:  
kò tʃáɾà ʔá **kũ̀ũ̀**  
**FOC** stone 1SG **see.3.INAN>1.INV**  
"The stone sees me."  

Example with suppletive root for 'see' (using low vowel root; suppletive roots maintain vowel height harmony and tone patterns despite non-standard syllable structures):  
Direct: ʔá sã̀lãɾã̀ **kɛ̃̀lɛ̃̀** (1SG>3.ANIM)  
Inverse: sã̀lãɾã̀ ʔá **kɔ̃̀lɔ̃̀** (3.ANIM>1.INV)  
"I see the person" vs. "The person sees me"  

Nouns lack case/number marking but carry inherent animacy-based gender: animate (humans, animals, e.g., **/sã̀lãɾã̀/** "person") and inanimate (objects, abstractions, e.g., **/tʃáɾà/** "stone"). Some nouns shift animacy via tone changes:  
- **/tʃíɾì/** (HL) "pebble" (inanimate) → **/tʃìɾì/** (LL) "spirit" (animate)  

Example:  
kò **tʃíɾì** ʔá **kũ̀ũ̀**  
FOC **pebble(INAN)** 1SG **see.3.INAN>1.INV**  
"The pebble sees me."  

kò **tʃìɾì** ʔá **kũ̀ũ̀**  
FOC **spirit(ANIM)** 1SG **see.3.ANIM>1.INV**  
"The spirit sees me."  

Many adjectives and adverbs derive from the first syllable of inflected verb forms via tone simplification: the tone of that syllable is reduced to a single level (e.g., H maintained; L maintained) while maintaining vowel height harmony. Some adjectives/adverbs are underived.  

Example (from 'go' kíì → adjective kí):  
tʃáɾà **kí**  
stone **far**  
"far stone"  

Example (from suppletive 'see' kɛ̃̀lɛ̃̀ → adjective kɛ̃̀):  
sã̀lãɾã̀ **kɛ̃̀**  
person **visible**  
"visible person"  

Example (underived):  
tʃáɾà **bɛ́**  
stone **big**  
"big stone"  

ʔá **kúù** **n̥ã́**  
1SG **go.1SG>3.INAN.DIR** **quickly**  
"I go quickly."  

Negation employs a preverbal particle **/à/**, which triggers a low tone pattern for all syllables in the verb (overriding the original tone pattern). Verbs already bearing a low-tone pattern remain unchanged under negation, with disambiguation relying on the particle /à/. Negated verb forms retain disyllabic CV.V structure (e.g., [kì.ì] for **kìì**).  

Example:  
ʔá tʃáɾà **à** **kĩ̀ĩ̀**  
1SG stone **NEG** **see.1SG>3.INAN.DIR.NEG**  
"I don't see the stone."  

Example with initial high tone:  
ʔá tʃáɾà **à** **kìì**  
1SG stone **NEG** **go.1SG>3.INAN.DIR.NEG**  
"I don't go to the stone."  

## Syntax

The language follows strict SOV word order with head-final structure. Basic clauses use Subject + Object + Verb order. Focused constituents move immediately after the focus particle, which may alter the basic SOV order. Modifiers (adjectives, relative clauses) follow heads, and postpositions replace prepositions. Pronouns are obligatorily retained. Adpositional phrases (PPs) typically appear after core arguments and before the verb. The particle **/kò/** serves distinct functions as a focus marker versus a postposition ('with'), with disambiguation relying solely on context and pragmatics.

Example (SOV):  
**sã̀lãɾã̀** tʃíɾì **ĩ̀ĩ̀**  
**person** pebble **see.3.ANIM>3.INAN.DIR**  
"The person sees the pebble."  

Example (Postposition (with)):  
ʔá tʃáɾà **kò** **kíì**  
1SG stone **with** **go.1SG>3.INAN.DIR**  
"I go with the stone."  

Focus particles precede focused constituents. The particle **/kò/** marks the focused constituent without altering verb agreement, which follows the animacy hierarchy. Focus on non-core arguments (e.g., adverbials) places the focused constituent after **/kò/** without affecting agreement.  

Example (Subject focus):  
**kò** ʔá tʃáɾà **kĩ̀ĩ̀**  
**FOC** 1SG stone **see.1SG>3.INAN.DIR**  
"*I* see the stone."  

Example (Object focus):  
**kò** tʃáɾà sã̀lãɾã̀ **ĩ̀ĩ̀**  
**FOC** stone person **see.3.ANIM>3.INAN.DIR**  
"The person sees *the stone*."  

Example (Subject focus with inverse verb):  
**kò** sã̀lãɾã̀ ʔá **kũ̀ũ̀**  
**FOC** person 1SG **see.3.ANIM>1.INV**  
"*The person* sees me."  

Adverbial focus:  
**kò** **n̥ã́** ʔá tʃáɾà **kíì**  
**FOC** **quickly** 1SG stone **go.1SG>3.INAN.DIR**  
"*Quickly*, I go to the stone."  

Relative clauses follow head nouns, use finite verbs, and have gaps indicating coreference. No relative pronouns are used. In possessor relative clauses, the relative clause modifies the possessor noun directly within the possessive phrase.  

Example (Object relative):  
[**tʃíɾì** ___ **ũ̀ũ̀**] **sã̀lãɾã̀**  
[**pebble** ___ **see.3.INAN>3.ANIM.INV**] **person**  
"the person [that the pebble sees]"  

Example (Subject relative with subject gap):  
[___ tʃíɾì **ĩ̀ĩ̀**] **sã̀lãɾã̀**  
[___ pebble **see.3.ANIM>3.INAN.DIR**] **person**  
**"the person [who sees the pebble]"  

Example (Possessor relative):  
[**sã̀lãɾã̀** [___ tʃíɾì **ĩ̀ĩ̀**]] **psì**  
[**person** [___ pebble **see.3.ANIM>3.INAN.DIR**]] **house**  
"the house of the person [who sees the pebble]"  

Yes/No questions use rising intonation (prosodic final H tone overlay) with optional particle **/ʔì/** (a function word). The particle's lexical tone remains unchanged. Content questions replace the constituent with an interrogative, leaving verb agreement unchanged.  

Example (Yes/No):  
sã̀lãɾã̀ tʃáɾà kĩ̀ĩ̀ **ʔì?**  
person stone see.3.ANIM>3.INAN.DIR **Q**  
"Does the person see the stone?"  

Example (Content):  
**má** tʃáɾà **ĩ̀ĩ̀**?  
**who** stone **see.3.ANIM>3.INAN.DIR**  
"Who sees the stone?"  

Coordination uses juxtaposition with comma intonation, omitting shared arguments in the second clause.  

Example:  
ʔá tʃáɾà **kíì**, (ʔá) sã̀lãɾã̀ **kĩ̀ĩ̀**  
1SG stone **go.1SG>3.INAN.DIR** (1SG) person **see.1SG>3.ANIM.DIR**  
"I go to the stone and see the person."  

Possession is marked by juxtaposition: Possessor + Possessed. Verbs agree with the animacy of the head noun (the possessed noun) in a possessed NP.  

Example:  
**sã̀lãɾã̀** **psì**  
**person** **house**  
"the person's house"  

**ʔá** **sã̀lãɾã̀** **psì** **kĩ̀ĩ̀**  
**1SG** **person** **house** **see.1SG>3.INAN.DIR**  
"I see the person's house."
