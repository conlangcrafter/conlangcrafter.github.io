# Grammar

## Morphology

The language is mostly isolating with minimal inflection. Tripartite alignment is marked by clitic particles for nouns: ergative /=pỹ́/, absolutive /=tsã̀/, and accusative /=dú/. Pronouns exhibit suppletive case forms rather than using case clitics and inflect for inclusivity in the 1st person plural. The simple present tense is zero-marked and uses a specific stem, which may differ from stems used in other tenses. Note that the animate classifier 'pú' is homophonous with the non-present stem of the verb 'see', and the 1PL.INCL.ABS pronoun 'stã́' is homophonous with the noun 'stã́' (man). TAM suffixes are exclusively bound morphemes that cannot stand alone, distinct from any homophonous free function words. Verbs may have multiple stems used in different contexts: for example, 'see' has present stem 'blỹ̀', non-present stem 'pú', and negative stem 'pù'. Particles (such as the negative particle `súzà` and question particle `nã́sù`), adpositions (e.g., `spízù`), and functional elements like relativizers (e.g., `bỹ̀ptã́`) are function words.

**Pronoun case suppletion example**  
`tỹ́ tã́ blỹ̀`  
`1SG.ERG 1SG.ABS see`  
"I see myself."  

`spỹ́ stã́ pú-tý`  
`1PL.INCL.ERG 1PL.INCL.ABS see-FUT`  
"We (inclusive) will see ourselves."  

Verbs lack agreement but take highly fused portmanteau suffixes encoding tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality. Negation employs negative concord and requires verb stem alternation. Possession. Nouns and adjectives are typically unmarked, though case clitics attach phrase-finally. Full reduplication of adjectives marks intensity; partial reduplication (C₁V₁-) of verbs marks distributivity, copying only the first consonant and vowel. For vowel-initial verb stems, reduplication copies the initial vowel only (V₁-). Non-firsthand evidentiality is marked by clitic /=zú/ on verbs, distinct from fused TAM evidentials.

**TAM suffix example**  
`dúspìzã̀ stã́=dú pú-sĩ́nù`  
`teacher man=ACC see-PST.PFV.DIR`  
"The teacher saw the man (I witnessed it)."  

`blỹ̀=pỹ́ stã́=dú pú-sĩ́nù=zú`  
`woman=ERG man=ACC see-PST.PFV.DIR=EVID.NONFIRSTHAND`  
"The woman saw the man (I was told)."  

**Possession example**  
`pú stã́=nã́ blỹ̀`  
`ANIM man=POSS woman`  
"The woman's man (husband)" [structure: classifier possessed=POSS possessor]  

`mã́=nã́ stã́`  
`house=POSS man`  
"The man's house."  

**Negation example**  
`súzà stã́=pỹ́ dànzí=dú pù`  
`NEG man=ERG nothing=ACC see.NEG`  
"The man sees nothing."  

**Adjective reduplication example**  
`mã́ dzà-dzà`  
`house big-REDUP`  
"A very big house."  

**Verb reduplication example**  
`stã́=pỹ́ mã́=tsã̀ bỹ̀-blỹ̀`  
`man=ERG house=ABS REDUP-see`  
"The man looks at each house."  

`stã́=pỹ́ ã́ptỹ̀=tsã̀ ã́-ã́ptỹ̀`  
`man=ERG river=ABS REDUP-cross`  
"The man crosses each river."  

`stã́=pỹ́ mã́=tsã̀ pú-pú-tý`  
`man=ERG house=ABS REDUP-see-FUT`  
"The man will look at each house."  

**Evidential clitic example**  
`stã́=pỹ́ mã́=tsã̀ blỹ̀=zú`  
`man=ERG house=ABS see=EVID.NONFIRSTHAND`  
"The man sees a house (I infer)."  

## Syntax

Word order is strictly SOV with strong head-finality. Noun phrases precede adpositions and in possessive constructions, the classifier directly precedes the possessed noun (which hosts =nã́), followed by the possessor. Adjectives follow nouns predominantly. TAM markers are suffixes on verbs. Negative concord requires co-occurrence of a clause-initial negative particle (`súzà`), a negative polarity item (e.g., `dànzí`), and verb stem alternation. Relative clauses are formed via nominalization with a final relativizer `bỹ̀ptã́`, where the verb takes a relativization suffix `-dú` (homophonous with but functionally distinct from the accusative clitic) to mark the verb as part of a relative clause, and the relativized argument is indicated by its absence. Adpositions are functional clitics that attach as enclitics to the entire case-marked NP. Case clitics attach to the final word of the noun phrase, and adpositions then encliticize to the entire case-marked unit. Interrogatives use in-situ interrogative pronouns (e.g., `màptỹ̀nã́` "who"); polar questions add the clause-final question particle `nã́sù`. Coordinate structures use conjunction `sĩ́nù` linking clauses, with no NP coordination—repeated clauses are required.

**Head-final example**  
`dúspìzã̀=pỹ́ spã́ndỳzúptĩ́=tsã̀ blỹ̀`  
`teacher=ERG book=ABS read`  
"The teacher reads the book."  

**Noun-adjective order**  
`mã́ dzà`  
`house big`  
"big house"  

**TAM position**  
`dúspìzã̀=pỹ́ mã́=dú pú-zàbý`  
`teacher=ERG house=ACC see-PRS.PROG`  
"The teacher is seeing the house."  

**Relative clause example**  
`[stã́=pỹ́ blỹ̀-dú bỹ̀ptã́] mã́`  
`man=ERG see-REL REL house`  
"The house that the man sees."  

`[mã́=tsã̀ blỹ̀-dú bỹ̀ptã́] stã́`  
`house=ABS see-REL REL man`  
"The man who sees the house."  

**Adposition enclitic example**  
`mã́=tsã̀=spízù stã́=pỹ́ blỹ̀`  
`house=ABS=inside man=ERG see`  
"The man sees (it) inside the house."  

**Interrogative example**  
`màptỹ̀nã́=pỹ́ mã́=tsã̀ blỹ̀`  
`who=ERG house=ABS see`  
"Who sees the house?"  

`blỹ̀=pỹ́ stã́=dú blỹ̀ nã́sù`  
`woman=ERG man=ACC see Q`  
"Does the woman see the man?"  

**Coordinate structure example**  
`stã́=pỹ́ mã́=tsã̀ blỹ̀ sĩ́nù blỹ̀=pỹ́ stã́=dú blỹ̀`  
`man=ERG house=ABS see and woman=ERG man=ACC see`  
"The man sees a house, and the woman sees the man."
