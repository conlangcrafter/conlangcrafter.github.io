# Phonology

## Consonants

|             | Bilabial | Alveolar |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Plosive     | p b      | t d      |
| Nasal       | m        | n        |
| Fricative   |          | s z      |
| Approximant |          | l        |

Note: Sequences like /ts/ and /dz/ are consonant clusters (e.g., /t/ + /s/, /d/ + /z/), not single affricate phonemes.

## Vowels

|           | Front unrounded | Front rounded | Back unrounded | Back rounded |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| Oral      | i               | y             | a              | u            |
| Nasal     | ĩ               | ỹ             | ã              |              |

Note: The back rounded nasal vowel slot is not phonemic and does not occur.

## Phonotactics

Syllable structure is unrestricted, allowing complex clusters in any position (e.g., CCCVCCC), with minimal phonotactic constraints; all consonants may appear freely in onsets or codas, and there are no vowel-specific restrictions.

## Suprasegmentals

The language employs a two-tone system (high and low) with phonemic tone on each syllable; stress is absent or lexically unpredictable and does not interact with tone or other features.

## Word Shapes and Lexical Statistics

Function words are predominantly monosyllabic or disyllabic, with simple to moderately complex structures, and are very common. Content words exhibit greater variability, ranging from monosyllabic to polysyllabic forms. Monosyllabic words are frequent overall, occurring in both functional and core lexical items. Disyllabic words are the most common pattern across all vocabulary. Trisyllabic content words are common, while quadrisyllabic or longer words are less common but not rare, typically appearing in derived or compound forms. Complex consonant clusters (e.g., CCC-) are more frequent in content words, especially in longer words, though they occasionally occur in function items. Nasal vowels and diverse tone combinations appear freely in all word types.
